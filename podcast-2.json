My name is Gautam Dhameja and in this episode, we are going to talk about ASICs and mining. So ASIC stands for Application Specific Integrated Circuit. Now these are special kind of chips that can do specific kind of computations based on the requirements of applications. Now in general how computers work is you have a chip in a computer, it's called the processor as well and it does the computations. Most of the time these chips are general purpose. When you run an operating system on the computer and then you run any kind of application, these chips will support those instructions coming from the applications. Now sometimes we need application specific chips or processors to do faster computations, more optimized computations for applications and this is where ASICs come into the picture. Now why am I talking about this on a blockchain podcast? Well, Bitcoin uses proof of work. Proof of work means solving a puzzle. That means doing a lot of computations to find out the hash of the block that confronts to a particular format and then whoever wins that race, whoever finds that hash quickly, that node gets to produce the block. So now you know this is a specific kind of application that is creating a lot of hashes per second. It requires a lot of hash power and that hash power requires specific computations, requires a specific kind of hardware and those hardware are your ASICs. So the way Bitcoin works is there is a concept of difficulty which means that the block should be produced on an average of 10 minutes and if it is easy to produce the block quicker than 10 minutes then the difficulty will be increased by the network. This is all automated by the way and nobody is sitting there and clicking on buttons to increase the difficulty or decrease the difficulty. If the block time becomes quicker then the difficulty increases so that it takes longer to create a block and if the block time becomes too much then the difficulty decreases so that the block time can come back to 10 minutes. So having said that, now whoever wins the race gets to produce the next block. If there are so many computers, so many nodes trying to win the race, they will add more and more and more hardware to win the race. This will also require a lot more energy. So when the general purpose processors were not able to compete on the Bitcoin network then came the ASICs. They are application specific integrated circuits or processors that are capable of doing one thing but one thing in a very fast and optimized manner and in this case that one thing is calculating hashes. How many number of hashes can an ASIC calculate per second and how many number of hashes can a general purpose processor calculate per second is very different. And this is where we need ASICs for Bitcoin mining. Now many different proof of work blockchains use ASICs for mining or let me put it this way. When people are running nodes for Bitcoin and other blockchains using proof of work networks, they use ASICs for mining. Sometimes these ASICs can be combined to create even more hash power. Like you know putting many ASICs together and creating a mining rig out of it. So this is all very common these days because at the end of the day the nodes have to win the race to produce the block. So they will put as much hash power as possible that comes in their budget that comes in their energy consumption budget and all of that. So this is in very brief what are ASICs, why they are used in Bitcoin mining and where is all of this coming from. It's all about just producing the block at a faster pace. I hope you found this insightful. Thank you for listening and I'll see you in the next episodes.

Gautam Dhameja explains how ASICs, specialized chips designed for specific computations, are used to calculate hashes quickly and efficiently. He highlights that Bitcoin's proof of work mechanism requires nodes to solve puzzles and produce blocks, which necessitates high hash power. As more nodes enter the mining race, they invest in ASICs to increase their chances of winning. Dhameja emphasizes the importance of ASICs in achieving faster block production while acknowledging their energy consumption. Overall, the episode provides valuable insights into the function and significance of ASICs in the context of blockchain mining."}
